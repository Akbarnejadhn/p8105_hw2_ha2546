In Mr. Trash Wheel data, we have 344 observations, and we have key
variables such as dumpster, month, year, and date. In resulting
precipitation dataset which we obtained from combining precipitation
data of 2017 and 2018, we have 24 total precipitation observations in
total and we have ey variables month and year. According to the
precipitation dataset, the total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33 inches
and the median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 is 8.

# Problem 2

## Part 1

Problem two was dealing with *FiveThirtyEight* data which was composed
of different .csv files. First, I started cleaning the data in
*pols\_month.csv* file by cleaning the names and seperating date
variable( *mon* ) into *year*, *month*, and *day* variables and then
converted them to integers. I then transformed month’s format to English
abbreviation format. On the next step, I made a new column named
*president* which will include information from *prez\_gop* and
*prez\_dem* columns, I just recoded the information in *prez\_gop*
column and removed these two columns, as well as the variable *day* that
was mentioned in the problem.

Note: I observed two “2” values in *prez\_gop* while the values in this
column should be either either “0” or “1”. So I just assumed these
values are supposed to be “1” and before recoding to the president
column, I replaced them with “1”.

``` r
pols_month_data = read_csv("data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[(month)],
    prez_gop = replace(prez_gop, prez_gop == "2", "1"),
    president = recode(prez_gop, "1" = "gop" , "0" = "dem"),
  ) %>% 
   select(year, month, president, everything(), -starts_with("prez"), -day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

## Part 2

Second, I cleaned the *snp.csv*. The process for cleaning this part is
very similar to part 1, the only thing different was that because of how
the data is structured, I also had to alter *year* and *month*
variables’ order and arrange them as my leading variables. I did not
select *day* variable in this part as well because of consistency with
previous part. Then I turned *month* from numeric format to English
abbreviation format.

``` r
snp_data = read_csv("data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), convert = TRUE) %>%
  select(year, month, close) %>% 
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[(month)]
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

## Part 3

In the third part, I tidied up the *unemplyment\_data*. This dataset is
composed of 1 column for year, and 12 columns for different months of a
year. To tidy this dataset, I had to transform it from wide format to
long format, using unemployment rates as my values and created a new
variable *month* instead of having each month as a variable. I then
cleaned the names of my columns using janitor. Deoing so makes the
dataset consitent with previous datasets and this will enable us to join
them on the next step.

``` r
unemployment_data = read_csv("data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemp_prcnt"
  ) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names()            
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

## Part 4

On the final step for this problem, I first left-joined the *snp\_data*
to *pols\_month\_data*, using key variables *year* and *month*, and then
left-joined the *unemployment\_data* to the
result.

``` r
join_pols_snp_unemp = left_join(pols_month_data, snp_data, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment_data, by = c("year", "month")) 
```

## Results

In problem 2, we were dealing with *pols\_month*, *snp*, and
*unemployment* datasets of the *FiveThirtyEight* data.

After tidying these datasets, *pols\_month* dataset’s dimension is 822,
9 which means it has 9 variables including *year* and *month* as key
variables, *president* which shows whether the president was republican
or democrat, and the number of governors ( *gov* ), the number of
senators ( *sen* ), and the number of representatives ( *rep* ) for both
republican and democratic parties on associated dates. The dataset
contains 822 observations for these variables, and the range of years
investigated is 68 years (between 1947, 2015).

The dimension of the resulting dataframe *snp\_data* is 787, 3 which
means it has 787 observations of 3variables including *year* (key
variable), *month* (key variable), and *close* (the closing values of
the S\&P stock index). The data recorded in this dataset is associated
with 65 years (between years 1950, 2015).

After cleaning up, the resulting *unemployment* dataset is a 816, 3
dimension dataset: 816 observations of 3 variables including key
variables *year* and *month*, and unemployement percentage (
*unemp\_prcnt* ) associated with these
dates.

## Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

``` r
pop_names_data = read_csv("data/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    childs_first_name = str_to_title(childs_first_name),
    gender = str_to_lower(gender),
    ethnicity = recode(ethnicity, "ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER", "WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC", "BLACK NON HISP" = "BLACK NON HISPANIC")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    ethnicity = str_to_title(ethnicity)               
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   `Year of Birth` = col_double(),
    ##   Gender = col_character(),
    ##   Ethnicity = col_character(),
    ##   `Child's First Name` = col_character(),
    ##   Count = col_double(),
    ##   Rank = col_double()
    ## )
